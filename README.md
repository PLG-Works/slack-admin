# Slackmin
![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@plgworks/slackmin.svg?style=flat)

Slackmin helps you in easy integration with slack to use slash commands, interactive endpoints, send alert messages, open modals. 
One use case is to develop admin functionality over slack.

## Why Slackmin?
- Security features involving signature verification, channel authentication, user authentication, team validation, domain validation 
    are taken care of by the exposed middlewares.
- The view submission parameters are extracted into key value pairs for ease of use.
- Message and Modal wrappers help in easy writing of messages and opening of modals.
- Support of interacting with multiple slack apps comes built-in with this package.
  This overcomes the limitation of maximum number of 25 slash commands supported by a slack app.

## Installation

```sh
npm install slackmin
```

## Initialize
While using the package, create an object of Slackmin at one place (in a provider) and then use it across the application.
```node.js
// slack admin provider's config
const Slackmin = require('slackmin');

const appConfigs = [
  {
    id: '<slack_app_id>',
    secret: '<slack_signing_secret>',
    slack_bot_user_oauth_token: '<slack_bot_user_oauth_token>'
  }
]

const whiteListedChannels = { '<slack_channel_id>': '1' }

const slackDomain = '<your_slack_domain>'

const whitelistedUsers = ['<slack_member_id>', '<slack_member_id>', '<slack_member_id>']

const slackAdmin = new Slackmin(
  appConfigs,
  whiteListedChannels,
  slackDomain,
  whitelistedUsers
);

module.exports = slackAdmin;
```

### Slackmin Params
**1. appConfigs**


`appConfigs` is an array of app config objects allowing slackmin to support multiple apps. Each app config in an object consisting of id, secret and token.

- **id**: You need to provide your slack app id here. To create a slack app visit https://api.slack.com/apps.
- **secret**: After you create your app, you can get signing secret from your app credentials. Slack signs the requests sent to you using this secret. We have provided a method that confirms each request coming from Slack by verifying its unique signature.
- **slack_bot_user_oauth_token**: Your app's presence is determined by the slack bot. A bot token in your app lets users at-mention it, add it to channels and conversations, and allows you to turn on tabs in your appâ€™s home. It makes it possible for users to interact with your app in Slack. In slackmin slack bot sends the message on the slack channel.

<br>

**2. whiteListedChannels**


`whiteListedChannels` is a channel id map consisting of whitelisted channels to execute the slash commands in. Slash commands will execute only in the whitelisted channels.

<br>

**3. slackDomain**


`slackDomain` is your slack app's workspace domain. It could be a team workspace or individual workspace. 

<br>

**4. whitelistedUsers**

`whitelistedUsers` is an array consisting of whitelisted user ids. User id is your member id on slack. Whitelisted users are channel admins that can execute commands in whitelisted channels.

## slackmin middleware usage

```javascript
const {
  formatPayload,
  sanitizeBodyAndQuery,
  assignParams,
  sanitizeDynamicUrlParams,
  sanitizeHeaderParams,
  extractSlackParams,
  validateSignature,
  validateSlackUser,
  validateSlackChannel,
  validateSlackApiAppId,
  extractResponseUrlFromPayload,
  extractText,
  extractResponseUrlFromBody,
  parseApiParameters,
  extractTriggerId
} = slackAdmin.middlewares;
```
### Slackmin Middlewares
**1. formatPayload**

`formatPayload` formats and preprocess the slack payload. Parse and regex replace processed links and user mention in slack payload. A slack payload is a JSON object that is used to define metadata about the message, such as where it should be published etc.
<br>

**2. sanitizeBodyAndQuery**

`sanitizeBodyAndQuery` recursively sanitize request body and request query params.

<br>

**3. assignParams**

`assignParams` assign params to request object, so it can be used in subsequent middlewares.

<br>

**4. sanitizeDynamicUrlParams**

`sanitizeDynamicUrlParams` recursively sanitize dynamic params in URL.

<br>

**5. sanitizeHeaderParams**

`sanitizeHeaderParams` recursively sanitize request headers.

<br>


**6. extractSlackParams**

`extractSlackParams` extract slack_id, team_domain and api_app_id from slack request payload in case of interactive endpoints.
It extract slack_id, team_domain, channel_id and response_url from request body in case of slash commands. 

<br>

**7. validateSignature**

`validateSignature` verify requests from slack by verifying signatures using signing secret.
The signature is created by combining the signing secret with the body of the request using a standard HMAC-SHA256 keyed hash.
                    
<br>

**8. validateSlackUser**

`validateSlackUser`perform slack user authentication. It verify if user is present in `whitelistedUsers`. 

<br>

**9. validateSlackChannel**

`validateSlackChannel`perform slack channel authentication. It validates if channel is listed in  `whiteListedChannels`. 
 
<br>

**10. validateSlackApiAppId**

`validateSlackApiAppId` validate slack app Id. It only allows request from provided apps in `appConfigs`.

<br>

**11. extractResponseUrlFromPayload**

`extractResponseUrlFromPayload` extract response_url from interactive routes. This middleware should only be used with interactive endpoints.

<br>

**12. extractText**

`extractText` extract text from slash command's request body. This middleware should only be used with slash commands.

<br>

**13. extractResponseUrlFromBody**

`extractResponseUrlFromBody` extract response_url from slash command's request body. This middleware should only be used with slash commands

<br>

**14. parseApiParameters**

`parseApiParameters` parse and get block_actions payload when a user interacts with block component.
Parse and get view_submission payload when users interact with modal views. This middleware should only be used with interactive endpoints. 

<br>

**15. extractTriggerId**

`extractTriggerId` extract trigger_id from interactive routes. This middleware should only be used with interactive routes.
 This middleware will not fetch triggerId for view_submission type interactions.

### Common Middlewares
```javascript
// common middlewares
// This set of middlewares can be used with slash commands as well as with interactive routes.
router.use(
  formatPayload,
  sanitizeBodyAndQuery,
  assignParams,
  extractSlackParams,
  validateSignature,
  validateSlackUser
)

// OR 

router.use(

//  interactive-endpoint middlewares
// This set of middlewares can be used with interactive routes.

router.post(
  '/interactive-endpoint',
  sanitizeDynamicUrlParams,
  sanitizeHeaderParams,
  validateSlackApiAppId,
  extractTriggerId,

## Interactive Components

Slack provides a range of visual components, called Block Kit, that can be used in messages. These blocks can be used to lay out complex information in a way that's easy to digest. Each block is represented in slack APIs as a JSON object. You can include up to 50 blocks in each message, and 100 blocks in modals.
You can find Block Kit reference [here](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks)

### Message Wrapper

slackmin Message wrapper allows us to create and format the message alert interface by enabling addition of various blocks.

```javascript
const message = new slackAdmin.interactiveElements.Message();
```

For example,
<br>
adding a section block

```javascript
message.addSection("I want to add some text here. And it should be *markdown*");
```
[Preview for message.addSection](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/T0394LH7H54#%7B%22blocks%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22section%22,%22text%22:%7B%22type%22:%22mrkdwn%22,%22text%22:%22I%20want%20to%20add%20some%20text%20here.%20And%20it%20should%20be%20*markdown*%22%7D%7D%5D%7D)


adding divider section
```javascript
message.addDivider()
```

adding button elements
```javascript
message.addButtonElements(
  [
    {
      buttonText: 'Click me 1',
      confirmText: 'You clicked the correct button 1',
      value: '{"action":"actionId-0"}'
    },
    {
      buttonText: 'Click me 2',
      confirmText: 'You clicked the correct button 2',
      value: '{"action":"actionId-1"}'
    }

### Modal Wrapper
slackmin Modal wrapper allows us to add various blocks in a popup.
```javascript
// appId is required to validate signature
// text here is modal's title text
const text = "Input Email"
const modal = new slackAdmin.interactiveElements.Modal(appId, text);
```
For example,
<br>

buttons on modal. we can change the text of the confirm button and cancel button.

```javascript
modal.addSubmitAndCancel("Confirm", "Close");
```

add input text box

```javascript
// takes params labelText(string), multiline(boolean), isOptional(boolean)
modal.addTextbox(
  "Your Email",
  false,
  false
)
```
